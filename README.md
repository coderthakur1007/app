# MindSift - Perplexity Clone using Flutter and FastAPI

**MindSift** is a project I developed that clones the **Perplexity** app, combining **Flutter** for the frontend and **FastAPI** for the backend. The app allows users to ask questions and get responses sourced from the internet in real-time using the **Gemini AI API**. Itâ€™s a perfect demonstration of how artificial intelligence can be seamlessly integrated into modern applications with Flutter and FastAPI.

## Project Overview

**MindSift** is a knowledge retrieval app that utilizes **Flutter** for building cross-platform mobile and web applications, and **FastAPI** to power the backend. The app leverages the **Gemini AI API** to fetch real-time answers for users' queries, creating an efficient and interactive user experience.
